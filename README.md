# Table Reservation Feature for Little Lemon Restaurant

### Hi everyone! 👋

This repository contains my submission for a UX/UI design project focused on creating a seamless Table Reservation Feature for a fictional restaurant called Little Lemon. This project was developed as part of the Meta Professional Certificate in UX/UI Design.

🌟 About Little Lemon
Little Lemon is a modern restaurant known for providing the best healthy food options in town. The restaurant offers dine-in, takeout, and delivery services through its dedicated app, catering to busy professionals who prioritize convenient and healthy meal choices.

🧩 The Problem
The Little Lemon App currently faces key usability challenges:

Inconsistent information across pages, leaving users unsure of how to proceed with placing orders.
Missing essential features like an "add to cart" button on the dish information page.
A cumbersome and unintuitive table reservation process, with no clear date or time selection options and a time-consuming form.
🎯 The Goal
Redesign the interface to resolve inconsistencies and improve user interaction.
Make the table reservation and online food ordering experience efficient and user-friendly.
Create a consistent and intuitive workflow to save users' time and reduce frustration.
🛠️ Approach
I followed the Design Thinking methodology to ensure the user remained at the center of the process, focusing on these five steps:

Empathize: Understand users' pain points through research.
Define: Identify and document core problems to address.
Ideate: Brainstorm and generate creative solutions.
Prototype: Develop a functional design prototype.
Test: Gather feedback and refine the design.
